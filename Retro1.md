## Weekly Retro Template  

**Goals for last Sprint**:

**Goals for this Sprint**:
Create a separate app strictly for vendors where they can update their locations, menus, coupons, specials etc. This app will feed a database the which will feed AccessFood.

**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):

  *  What went well?
  We were able to add a sign-in with Facebook button, use to Yelp API to retrieve food truck data, create a complete login activity and profile activity. 
  *  What should we do differently next time?
  We need to better research what it takes to implement a feature before we dive into it.
  *  What still puzzles us?
  The best way to get user feed back and what is needed to create the vendor app.
 
**Team Member Analysis**:
If you did not meet your goals, how will this affect the progression of the product? What will you do differently to meet your goals this week?

Our mentor helped us a lot with the Yelp API. He also advised as against using a navigation drawer because we would have to change all our activities to fragments.
